# CC Switch

Source: https://github.com/farion1231/cc-switch
Revision: `889b797d8aa252299221ed6569f992bda0a31a72`

Adapted components and provider preset data:
- `src/components/providers/ProviderCard.tsx`, `ProviderCardActions.tsx`,
  `ProviderList.tsx` and provider form sections in the corresponding Web components.
- Direct API preset settings from `src/config/{claude,codex,gemini}ProviderPresets.ts`
  in `apps/supervisor-web/src/components/upstreamPresets.ts` (189 presets).
- Claude, Codex and Gemini field lists from `src-tauri/src/live/floor.rs`
  in `crates/runtime/src/upstreams/cc_switch.rs`. Tool credentials and helper
  commands are preserved as global user settings at the integration boundary.
- Provider fragment capture/projection and outgoing live backfill from
  `src-tauri/src/live/project` and `src-tauri/src/services/provider/live.rs`
  in `upstreams/provider_config.rs` and `upstreams.rs`.
- Plan/stage/reread/rename conflict checks from `src-tauri/src/live/engine.rs`
  in `upstreams/write_engine.rs` and `upstreams.rs`.

Pockymoe retains its profile store, backups, private atomic writes, harness
session gates and HTTP API. CC Switch's Tauri database, desktop services, local
proxy, OAuth accounts and arbitrary supplier usage scripts are not copied.
DSH YAML projection is an original adapter against the local DSH provider schema.
