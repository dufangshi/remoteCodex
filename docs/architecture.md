# Architecture

Pockymoe is a self-hosted control plane for personal coding-agent sessions.

```text
Browser / mobile WebView / native macOS app
  -> Supervisor (Axum, this repo)
      -> Runtime trait
           -> ACP stdio + thin harness adapters
           -> deterministic fake runtime (tests)
      -> SQLite journal (threads, turns, history items)
  -> optional Relay (outbound device tunnel)
```

## Ownership

| Crate | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/protocol` | JSON DTOs shared with the React client |
| `crates/runtime` | SQLite journal, workspace files, ACP catalog, fake runtime, thread service |
| `crates/supervisor` | HTTP + WebSocket + relay tunnel client |
| `crates/relay` | Public accounts, devices, shares |
| `crates/cli` | `pockymoe` binary |

## Module layout

Harness differences stay under `crates/runtime/src/acp/` — `catalog.rs` holds the
command catalog, `capabilities.rs` the capability overlays, and per-harness
adapters (`grok.rs`, `codex_bridge.rs`, `deepseek.rs`) sit alongside them.
Supervisor code does not special-case Codex vs Grok.

Large modules follow a `foo.rs` + sibling `foo/` convention: the parent file
keeps the public surface and the directory holds cohesive internals. Existing
examples are `runtime/src/service.rs` + `service/{reliability,update}.rs`,
`runtime/src/upstreams.rs` + `upstreams/discovery.rs`,
`supervisor/src/secure_transport.rs` + `secure_transport/streams.rs`, and
`relay/src/auth_api.rs` + `auth_api/passkeys.rs`. Prefer extending that pattern
over growing a single file; see [code-structure.md](code-structure.md) for the
current size inventory and the modules that most need it.

## Clients

Native Android/iOS/Windows clients are not duplicated in this rewrite. They keep
talking to the same HTTP/WS contract from `main`. The React thread surface stays
in `pockymoe-thread-ui`, consumed by `apps/supervisor-web` as
`@pockymoe/thread-ui` and `@pockymoe/shared`.

The native macOS/iOS/Android client apps live in a separate repository
(`remote-codex-app`), not in this tree — `apps/ios` and `apps/android` here hold
only built web bundles and packaging inputs. `apps/windows-device-manager` is an
independently released bootstrap; see AGENTS.md for its release boundary.
