# Device monitoring

`GET /api/device/metrics` returns a camelCase `DeviceMetricsDto`. The device
Supervisor collects CPU and memory locally, and the relay forwards the endpoint
through normal authenticated transport. Owners and device-scoped grants may read
it; thread/workspace-scoped grants cannot inspect the host.

CPU percentages use native counter differences through `sysinfo`, shared between
readers. First use, and reopening after a pause longer than 15 seconds, warm the
counter for one second. `sampleWindowMs` describes the averaging interval.
Basic readings cache for two seconds; optional hardware sensors cache for ten.
There is no always-running collector when nobody is viewing the device.

Memory uses native total and available physical RAM in bytes; used memory is
total minus available, including reclaimable memory according to the OS. Swap
or the page file is separate. WSL reports the Linux VM rather than Windows host
RAM. Containers expose OS-visible CPU/RAM plus available cgroup limits separately.

| WSL     | Linux VM counters, per logical CPU      | WSL NVIDIA driver where supported; host power is usually unavailable                                                                   |

Power is measured watts, never thermal design power or an estimate from CPU
utilization. Package/board readings can include more than CPU/GPU compute units;
they are not total device power and must not be added to estimate wall power.
Unsupported, malformed, permission-denied or timed-out sensor readings are null,
with a reason. Zero remains a valid measured value. RAPL collects only package
domains and handles one counter wrap; long gaps re-prime rather than guess wraps.
The app does not install drivers, change sensor permissions or ask for a password.
macOS can use an already-authorized noninteractive `sudo -n` for powermetrics.
Linux can similarly read the specific energy counters through already-authorized
`sudo -n /usr/bin/cat -- ...`; failed privileged probes back off for one minute.
MSR and MMIO representations of the same `package-N` are alternatives, never
added together. CPU hwmon power (`zenpower` / `fam15h_power`) is a fallback. The
first/reopened readable RAPL sample warms for one second and returns watts.

CPU temperature uses CPU-only hwmon drivers or CPU thermal zones on Linux;
package/Tdie values take precedence over core values. SSD, Wi-Fi and generic ACPI
thermal zones are excluded. macOS uses sysinfo’s native Intel SMC / Apple Silicon
IOHID reader, with Intel powermetrics SMC temperatures as a fallback. Windows
uses CPU Package/Tdie temperatures from LibreHardwareMonitor when installed.
`cpuTemperature` includes Celsius, source/reason and individually labeled sensors;
the UI collapses these details and shows unavailable reasons without requiring hover.

## Linux sensor access

RAPL `energy_uj` is commonly root-readable only. An interface being present does
not imply the Supervisor account can read it. Neither switching from sysfs to
MSR/perf nor installing `sensors` bypasses that permission. Do not grant blanket
root access to the Supervisor, expose all MSRs, or use TDP/limits as measured power.

An administrator can grant the Supervisor’s existing private group read access
to just the CPU package counter. For the audited Ubuntu host (user/group
`ubuntu`, package `intel-rapl:0`), the commands are:

```bash
sudo chgrp ubuntu /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:0/energy_uj
sudo chmod g+r /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:0/energy_uj
```

For other hosts, first verify the service user/group and each zone’s `name`;
authorize each physical package. These sysfs permissions reset on boot. For a
persistent setup, an administrator can install a narrow udev rule (substitute
the intended group) and trigger existing powercap devices:

```udev
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="powercap", KERNEL=="intel-rapl:*", ATTR{name}=="package-*", RUN+="/usr/bin/chgrp ubuntu /sys%p/energy_uj", RUN+="/usr/bin/chmod g+r /sys%p/energy_uj"
```

Save under `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-pockymoe-rapl.rules`, then run
`sudo udevadm control --reload-rules` and
`sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=powercap --action=add`. The collector
retries ordinary reads on the next hardware sample, without a Supervisor restart.

## macOS sensor access and limits

`powermetrics` is an Apple-provided interface but normally requires administrator
access. The collector chooses Apple Silicon CPU/GPU samplers or Intel CPU/SMC
samplers, with a CPU-only fallback if optional samplers are absent. An existing,
restricted sudo policy for the exact read-only command can permit the fallback;
Pockymoe never prompts for a password or edits that policy. Native
temperature availability varies by chip/macOS version, even with administrator
access; absent sensors remain null. IOReport Energy Model can provide unprivileged
Apple Silicon energy data on some versions, but is a private ABI; this collector
does not claim support or infer watts from unrelated channels.

The Web button appears in the mobile topbar and desktop icon rail above Settings,
remaining visible when the chat sidebar is collapsed. Opening it shows
per-core bars, used/total RAM, swap and available GPU/power readings. A failed or
stale sample replaces button percentages with dashes; the details retain the last
sample with its age. Hidden browser tabs pause polling. Older Supervisors display
an update instruction instead of fabricated zeroes.

Validation covers Linux native samples against `/proc/stat` and `/proc/meminfo`,
concurrent reader caching, the isolated HTTP endpoint, relay scope restrictions,
and Windows/macOS/NVIDIA provider fixtures. Browser regressions cover both desktop
and mobile (including 320px width), details, keyboard dismissal and stale samples.
Sensor availability on real hardware remains conditional on its drivers and access.

# Turn progress indicator

Running turns retain three animated dots. `Last progress · Ns ago` shows the age
of the last received text, plan, tool, context, subagent, request or turn/usage
event for that turn. Socket pings, polling, expanding history and rerendering do
not reset it. Initial/reloaded views fall back to recorded activity timestamps.
Silence does not itself mark a turn stuck or finished; known background agents
continue to have their own explicit status.
