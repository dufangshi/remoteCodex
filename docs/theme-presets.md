# Theme presets

Settings → Preferences → Appearance offers a **Theme** (preset) and a **Color mode**
(Light, Dark, System). Both are stored per browser, and every preset supports both
modes.

| Preset | Look |
| --- | --- |
| Classic (default) | Quiet green-neutral workbench |
| Plum Pocket | Plum chrome, mustard felt accents and cream content, rounded fonts, agent mascot avatars and the pocket sticker |

## How it works

- `apps/supervisor-web/src/lib/themePreset.ts` stores the preset in
  `localStorage['pockymoe-theme-preset']` and sets `<html data-theme-preset>` at
  startup, on change and when another tab changes it. The color mode stays on
  `data-theme-effective`.
- **Classic** is the base styling: `apps/supervisor-web/src/matter-theme.css` for the
  outer pages and the shared UI's `styles/matter-workbench.css` for the workbench and
  dialogs.
- A preset is one stylesheet under `apps/supervisor-web/src/theme-presets/`, imported
  from `index.css`. It overrides the same tokens one step more specifically:
  - main app tokens (`--app-*`, `--theme-*`) on `:root:root:root[data-theme-preset='…']`,
    with a `[data-theme-effective='light']` variant;
  - shared UI tokens (`--thread-gc-*`, `--matter-*`) on `.thread-ui-shell` and
    `.thread-graph-dialog` under the preset attribute, with a dark variant.
- Some shared UI rules hard-code Classic's slate neutrals. A preset that changes the
  neutrals overrides those rules too; `plum-pocket.css` has the current list.
- The terminal (xterm) and the file editor and diff view (Monaco) paint with
  JavaScript palettes. They read optional hex colors from CSS, `--terminal-bg`,
  `--terminal-fg`, `--terminal-cursor`, `--terminal-selection` on `.terminal-panel`
  and `--editor-bg`, `--editor-fg` and related `--editor-*` variables on an
  ancestor, and re-read them when `data-theme-preset` changes
  (`components/themeHooks.ts` in the shared UI). Without them they keep the Classic
  palette.
- Thread rows and tabs carry `<span class="matter-thread-avatar" data-agent="…">`,
  hidden by default. A preset can show it with a background image per agent.
  Plum Pocket's images are in `apps/supervisor-web/public/theme/plum-pocket/`.

## Adding a preset

1. Add its id to `THEME_PRESETS`, a card in `components/ThemePresetSettings.tsx`, a
   `themeChromeColor` entry and the `files.themePreset…` strings in the shared UI
   translations.
2. Add `theme-presets/<id>.css` and import it from `index.css`.
3. Check both color modes on desktop and phone, including dialogs, menus, the
   composer, code blocks and the outer pages. `e2e/settings-appearance.spec.ts`
   covers switching and persistence.
