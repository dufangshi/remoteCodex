When and how to read, wait for and acknowledge mail.

## When to read your inbox

Waiting mail is announced at the start of a turn with a bounded digest, prioritizing
questions/tasks over results/status. It is not a complete mailbox and does not enter
an already running turn. Batch reads at natural boundaries:

- **When the notice names something.** It tells you what is waiting; decide then
  whether it changes what you are about to do.
- **Before work that depends on a peer.** A result you never read is a result you do
  not have.
- **After a meaningful build/test/batch finishes.** Mail may have arrived meanwhile;
  do not reread the entire inbox after every small tool call.
- **When you have nothing else to do but expect mail:** block on it with
  `pockymoe inbox wait` rather than ending your turn or looping.

```bash
pockymoe inbox list --kind question --kind task
pockymoe inbox list --from-thread producer --kind result
pockymoe inbox wait --kind result --kind question   # result or an upstream blocker
pockymoe inbox wait --from-thread reviewer --kind result --kind question
pockymoe inbox wait --new                           # deliberately defer old mail
```

`inbox wait` returns the matching messages with text inline. Unacknowledged mail
satisfies it immediately, so acknowledge what you have handled (or use `--new` / a
filter while deliberately deferring something). Filtering happens before the bounded
page is selected. Preserve the filters when paging with `--before`. Acknowledge only
what you have handled or deliberately recorded. Ack removes mail from unread views;
it neither deletes history nor proves task success. Do not ack an unanswered question
merely to hide it: current thread waits treat its ack as no longer waiting.

When waiting for results, include questions so a producer asking you for missing input
can unblock you. Sender filters must include any peer whose question you must answer.
Do not have two agents wait on each other's result without naming and resolving the
dependency; expose blockers in the task board or a question instead of repeatedly
waking both to ask for status. For a long-lived producer's intermediate batches, wait
for inbox results rather than its whole thread to finish.

### Ending your turn discards nothing, but nothing will wake you

An idle thread does not run, so it cannot read mail. Completion notifications are
passive too - `--notify-on-complete` files a message, it does not start a turn for you.
So if you delegate and then simply end your turn, the result **sits in your inbox**
until a person or a peer starts your next turn.

- **If you must act on the result, stay in your turn** and block on it:
  `thread wait NAME` or `inbox wait`. Do independent work first if you have any.
- **If your turn must end, hand off explicitly** with `thread wait NAME... --wake`, and
  say in your final message what you delegated and that you will resume when it lands.

`--wake` is a receiver-owned, one-shot wait for your descendants, not a subscription
to arbitrary sibling artifacts. Only register it when you need the continuation.

Do not work around this by steering the peer, polling `status` in a loop, or sending
yourself direct messages; `wait` is cheaper than all of them.


## Read and acknowledge your inbox

```bash
pockymoe inbox
pockymoe inbox list --limit 10
pockymoe inbox list --kind result --kind question --from-thread producer
pockymoe inbox read MESSAGE_ID
pockymoe inbox ack MESSAGE_ID
pockymoe inbox list --all --limit 10
```

The caller's identity selects the mailbox. `--thread THREAD_ID` explicitly selects another mailbox, including from a shell without managed thread identity. IDs/URLs address the same local Supervisor; attribution is not a per-agent security boundary.

List returns bounded previews (240 characters) and envelope metadata. It defaults to 20 active unread messages, capped at 100, displaying the selected page chronologically. `--kind` and `--from-thread` are repeatable on list/wait. Follow `nextBefore` with `--before MESSAGE_ID`, preserving filters and `--all` if used. `--all` includes acknowledged and superseded history. One page need not contain every unread message.

Read returns at most 8192 Unicode characters. Follow `nextTextOffset` with `inbox read MESSAGE_ID --text-offset OFFSET` when needed. Reading does **not** mark mail processed, including after a crash. Acknowledge only messages you have handled or deliberately recorded for later action. `ack` accepts 1–100 explicit IDs atomically and is safe to repeat; acknowledged messages remain accessible with `--all` or `read`. Do not mark messages acknowledged merely to hide a queue count.

A reply uses the sender's `fromThreadId`:

```bash
pockymoe thread send SENDER_ID --kind result --subject 'Requested build result' \
  --in-reply-to MESSAGE_ID --text-file /tmp/result.txt
pockymoe inbox ack MESSAGE_ID
```

An idle sender will not wake for a passive reply. The sender must collect or register
its own wake; do not upgrade results to direct/queue to compensate. Include the
concrete response destination and handoff conditions in delegated instructions.
