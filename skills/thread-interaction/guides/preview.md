Web previews: show a local web app to the user.

## Show a local website to the user

When the user asks to view an app, or your task calls for delivering a runnable
web preview, reserve its address **before starting the HTTP service**:

```bash
remote-codex preview create --port 4013 --label "App preview"
# Read JSON: hostname (exact host), origin, url and openUrl.
# Configure the framework if needed, then start HTTP on 127.0.0.1:4013.
remote-codex preview check 4013
remote-codex preview list
# Optional: probe a known WebSocket endpoint (not a complete browser HMR test).
remote-codex preview check 4013 --websocket-path /ws
# Revoke when no longer needed; this does not stop the HTTP process.
remote-codex preview stop 4013
```

- Creation reserves a mapping, **not a running server**. Repeating it for an
  enabled port keeps the same address. Stop then recreate gets a new address;
  update exact-host configuration accordingly. Avoid stopping another task's
  mapping; mappings are device-wide, not thread-local.
- Bind to loopback in the Supervisor's own network namespace. For Vite use a
  fixed port (`--strictPort`) so automatic port fallback cannot break the mapping.
- If the installed framework requires a host/origin allowlist, add only the
  returned `hostname` or `origin`, matching that setting's expected format;
  preserve existing entries. Examples: Vite `server.allowedHosts`, webpack
  `devServer.allowedHosts`, Django `ALLOWED_HOSTS`; Next.js dev-origin restrictions
  use `allowedDevOrigins`. Inspect the installed version. Do not use `*`,
  `allowedHosts: true`, disable host checks or permit a whole shared domain.
  The gateway forwards a loopback Host and original `X-Forwarded-Host`, so many
  apps need no host change. Do not edit allowlists without a framework need.
- Diagnose before changing configuration: `serviceNotRunning` means check the
  process/port/bind address; `hostRejected` means inspect the precise rejection;
  `httpError` alone does not prove an allowlist problem. A successful HTTP check
  does not certify public DNS, TLS, account access or hot reload.
- If the page works but hot reload fails, inspect the actual browser WebSocket
  endpoint, protocol, port, auth token and subprotocol. Prefer same-origin WS.
  For confirmed public-endpoint issues, Vite uses `server.ws` (older versions:
  `server.hmr`); use the assigned host, public scheme/port, never the user's
  localhost. WebSocket probes require the actual endpoint and may fail when
  framework-specific auth/subprotocols are required.
- Give the user **`openUrl`** as the clickable entry. It authenticates in their
  browser and opens `url`; the mapped hostname can also initiate browser login.
  Previews remain private to the device owner; shared device access alone does
  not grant preview access. Never copy account tokens or one-use launch tickets
  into reports or CLI commands. CLI output contains neither.
- A disconnected Supervisor, disabled preview gateway or old runtime/Relay must
  be fixed explicitly. Do not invent a domain or bypass authentication. See
  `remote-codex preview --help`; an older installation may need updating.
